> OwO, What's this?

Peradaban is a Discord Server Bots designed only for Warung International.

## Development

This project is open to anyone who wants to contribute, large or small! Whether you noticed a typo or want to add a whole new feature, go for it!

Large additions should be discussed in issues or on Discord first. If you're new to Python, ask me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/351150966948757504) for where to start and you can use Peradaban as a starting point for a contribution.

Also, Please note that this code is _Production Ready_. It means, this code is a live source code of our discord server bot.

## Testing/Workflow

To run the app, you need:

- A Discord server to test - you can't use the Warung International Discord Server to do tests
- Python 3.1x.x - no guarantees on older versions
- A Discord bot with the 'Server Members Intent' enabled
- MongoDB Server, or MongoDB Atlas.

If you don't own/admin a Discord server, creating one is simple, you can do it from the same menu you join discord servers from.
