> OwO, What's this?

Peradaban is a Discord Server Bots made with [NAFF](https://github.com/Discord-Snake-Pit/NAFF) designed only for Warung International.
Visit [the official guide](https://naff.readthedocs.io/Guides/01%20Getting%20Started/) to get started.

## Development

This project is open to anyone who wants to contribute, large or small! Whether you noticed a typo or want to add a whole new feature, go for it!

Large additions should be discussed in issues or on Discord first. If you're new to Python, ask me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/351150966948757504) for where to start and you can use Peradaban as a starting point for a contribution.

Also, Please note that this code is _Production Ready_. It means, this code is a live source code of our discord server bot.

## Testing/Workflow

To run the app, you need:

- A Discord server to test - you can't use the Warung International Discord Server to do tests
- Python 3.1x.x - no guarantees on older versions
- A Discord bot with the 'Server Members Intent' enabled
- MongoDB Server, or MongoDB Atlas.

If you don't own/admin a Discord server, creating one is simple, you can do it from the same menu you join discord servers from.

## Running the Application
There are multiple ways to launch the application.

### Python
To start the bot with python, you first need to install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, run:

1) `python main.py`


### Docker-Compose
You can use the pre-made docker-compose by running:

1) `docker-compose up`

### Docker
For most users, the use of `docker-compose` is highly recommended.

Nevertheless, you can import the pre-made Dockerfile into your own docker-compose or run it manually by with:

1) `docker build -t your_project_name .`
2) `docker run -it your_project_name`

Note: Make sure that you created a volume so that you local `./logs` folder gets populated.

# Additional Information
Additionally, this comes with a pre-made [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) config to keep your code clean.

It is recommended that you set this up by running:

1) `pip install pre-commit`
2) `pre-commit install`
